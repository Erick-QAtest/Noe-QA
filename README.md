# Erick Noe CortÃ©s PeÃ±a - QA Portfolio

ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm a bilingual Jr. QA Tester with a unique combination of analytical thinking and legal experience, complemented by technical training in testing. Passionate about quality and system logic, with a keen eye for detail and error identification. In this GitHub portfolio, I demonstrate my skills and projects relevant to the QA role.

## About Me

I am a results-oriented professional with experience in applying agile methodologies (Scrum) and using modern tools such as Jira, Postman, Charles, API, and SQL[cite: 4]. My goal is to deliver high-quality products and I have a strong interest in AI and Legal Tech[cite: 5].

My legal background provides me with a solid foundation for critical analysis, the identification of inconsistencies, and the construction of sound arguments, skills that are directly transferable to software testing. As an Independent Litigating Attorney, I applied critical thinking and detailed analysis to identify "errors" in legal drafting and logic, preventing case failures[cite: 13].
